Microeconomic Systems
=====================

In 1960 and 1973 Leonid Hurwicz presented a framework for studying microeconomic systems.  His framework consisted of four elements.  

.. TODO: replace the $ stuff $ with images or mathjax 
1. An environment, $e in E$ which defines the initial state of the microeconomic system, $q^0 \in Q$ and described the agents who make decisions in order to change state.  

2. An institution, $I$, which defines a message space, $M$, that allow agents to coordinate their actions in order to change the state of the microeconomic system, and rules, $G = {g_1, ..., }$ which govern the admissibility of a message, and rules $H = {h_1, ..., }$ which change state based on the messages received.

3. A performance measure, $F: Q \to R$ which determines the value of being in state $q \in Q$. 

4. Behavioral functions $b_k \in B$, such that, $m_k = b_k(e, I)$ 

mTree projects use the microeconomic systems framework to run simulations and experiments a delimited sets of variables in a well-defined environment.
This framework was first proposed and adapted to experimental economics by Vernon Smith in 1982.
