Quick Start Guide
=================

In this **Quick Start Guide**, we are going to run a simple **mTree** simulation 
while giving an overview of key components that are necessary for **mTree** to execute 
without error. The goal of this guide is to show you how to run an mTree simulation from 
start to finish and point out the vital indicators that convey a simulation has run properly. 

Cloning mTree_auction_examples
================================


We are going to clone the **mTree_auction_examples** repository, which can
be found `here <https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_learning_exercises>`_, and run one 
of the examples to  **mTree** is running properly. 


Open your command prompt and navigate to an apporpriate place using  within your 
file system where you want to clone the repository and run the following code - 

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/gmucsn/mTree_auction_examples.git

This will create a **mTree_auction_examples** folder at your specified 
location.


Running mTree_auction_examples 
==============================

In order to run this simulation we need to create a **docker container** using 
the **Docker Desktop** app that we downloaded in  :doc:`installation` section. 

Follow all the steps highlighted in the :ref:`mTree-container-setup` section 
and set the **Host Path** to the folder where you downloaded
